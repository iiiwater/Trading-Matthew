Pretzel Logic 

Here's a pattern that everyone who uses this site NEEDS to familiarize themselves with: The Expanded Flat (this is not my graphic, btw).

A lot of times during a fast intraday, I may make a comment such as "XX [price] looks like a b-wave low" -- if that price is THE most recent near-term swing low and the market is bouncing, then I am saying, "I think the low is part of an expanded flat." Or, more directly: "I THINK WE'RE STILL ULTIMATELY HEADED LOWER." At least to or below the b-wave low, anyway.

Vice-versa if I say, "XX looks like a b-wave high." In that case, I'm saying, "I THINK WE'RE STILL HEADED HIGHER, AT LEAST BEYOND THAT XX B-WAVE PRICE POINT." (not necessarily FAR beyond it; that depends on the surrounding factors, but at least to or beyond that b-wave price point.)

Once you understand THIS pattern, then you understand why I'm saying what I'm saying, and what it means.
